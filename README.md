When you’re developing an information system to automate the activities of the business, you are modeling the business.
The abstractions that you design, the behaviors that you implement, and the UI interactions that you build all reflect
the business — together, they constitute the model of the domain.

## `IOR<Library, Inspiration>`

This project can be used as a library, or as an inspiration, or both. It provides just enough tactical Domain-Driven
Design patterns, optimised for Event Sourcing and CQRS.

- The `domain` model library is fully isolated from the application layer and API-related concerns. It represents a pure
  declaration (pure functions) of the program logic. It is written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) programming
  language, without additional
  dependencies. [![Maven Central - domain](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.fraktalio.fmodel/domain.svg?label=Maven%20Central)](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:%22com.fraktalio.fmodel%22%20AND%20a:%22domain%22)
- The `application` library orchestrates the execution of the logic by loading state, executing `domain` components and
  storing new state. It is written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) programming language,
  with [Arrow](https://arrow-kt.io/) as additional
  dependency. [![Maven Central - application](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.fraktalio.fmodel/application.svg?label=Maven%20Central)](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:%22com.fraktalio.fmodel%22%20AND%20a:%22application%22)

## Abstraction and generalization

Abstractions can hide irrelevant details and use names to reference objects. It emphasizes what an object is or does
rather than how it is represented or how it works.

Generalization reduces complexity by replacing multiple entities which perform similar functions with a single
construct.

Abstraction and generalization are often used together. Abstracts are generalized through parameterization to provide
more excellent utility.

## `decide: (C, S) -> Iterable<E>`

On a higher level of abstraction, any information system is responsible for handling the intent (`Command`) and based on
the current `State`, produce new facts (`Events`):

- given the current `State/S` *on the input*,
- when `Command/C` is handled *on the input*,
- expect `list/iterable` of new `Events/E` to be published *on the output*

## `evolve: (S, E) -> S`

The new state is always evolved out of the current state `S` and the current event `E`:

- given the current `State/S` *on the input*,
- when `Event/E` is handled *on the input*,
- expect new `State/S` to be published *on the output*

## Event-sourced or State-stored systems

- State-stored systems are traditional systems that are only storing the current State by overwriting the previous State
  in the storage.
- Event-sourced systems are storing the events in immutable storage by only appending.

### A statement:

Both types of systems can be designed by using only these two functions and three generic parameters:

- `decide: (C, S) -> Iterable<E>`
- `evolve: (S, E) -> S`

There is more to it! You can switch from one system type to another or have both flavors included within your systems
landscape.

### A proof:

We can fold/recreate the new state out of the list of events by using `evolve` function `(S, E) -> S` and providing the
initialState of type S as a starting point.

- `Iterable<E>.fold(initialState: S, ((S, E) -> S)): S`

Essentially, this `fold` is a function that is mapping a list of Events to the State:

- `(Iterable<E>) -> S`

We can now use this function `(Iterable<E>) -> S` to:

- contra-map our `decide` function (`(C, S) -> Iterable<E>`) over `S` type to: `(C, Iterable<E>) -> Iterable<E>`  - **
  this is an event-sourced system**
- or to map our `decide` function (`(C, S) -> Iterable<E>`) over `E` type to: `(C, S) -> S` - **this is a state-stored
  system**

We can verify that we can design any information system (event-sourced or/and state-stored) in this way by using these
two functions wrapped in a datatype class (algebraic data structure), which is generalized with three generic
parameters:

```kotlin
data class Decider<C, S, E>(
    val decide: (C, S) -> Iterable<E>,
    val evolve: (S, E) -> S,
)
```

`Decider` is the most important datatype, but it is not the only one. There are others:

![onion architecture image](.assets/onion.svg)

## Decider

`_Decider` is a datatype that represents the main decision-making algorithm. It belongs to the Domain layer. It has five
generic parameters `C`, `Si`, `So`, `Ei`, `Eo` , representing the type of the values that `_Decider` may contain or use.
`_Decider` can be specialized for any type `C` or `Si` or `So` or `Ei` or `Eo` because these types do not affect its
behavior. `_Decider` behaves the same for `C`=`Int` or `C`=`YourCustomType`, for example.

`_Decider` is a pure domain component.

- `C` - Command
- `Si` - input State
- `So` - output State
- `Ei` - input Event
- `Eo` - output Event

We make a difference between input and output types, and we are more general in this case. We can always specialize down
to the 3 generic parameters: `typealias Decider<C, S, E> = _Decider<C, S, S, E, E>`

```kotlin
data class _Decider<C, Si, So, Ei, Eo>(
    val decide: (C, Si) -> Iterable<Eo>,
    val evolve: (Si, Ei) -> So,
    val initialState: So,
    val isTerminal: (Si) -> Boolean
)

typealias Decider<C, S, E> = _Decider<C, S, S, E, E>
```

Additionally, `initialState` of the Decider and `isTerminal` function are introduced to gain more control over the
initial and final state of the Decider.

### Decider extensions and functions

`Decider` defines a `monoid` in respect to the composition
operation: `(Decider<Cx?,Sx,Ex?>, Decider<Cy?,Sy,Ey?>) -> Decider<Either<Cx,Cy>, Pair(Sx,Sy), Either<Ex,Ey>>`, and this
is an associative binary operation `a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c`, with identity element `Decider<Nothing, Unit, Nothing>`

> A monoid is a type together with a binary operation (combine) over that type, satisfying associativity and having an identity/empty element.
> Associativity facilitates parallelization by giving us the freedom to break problems into chunks that can be computed in parallel.

#### Contravariant

- `Decider<C, Si, So, Ei, Eo>.mapLeftOnCommand(f: (Cn) -> C): Decider<Cn, Si, So, Ei, Eo>`

#### Profunctor (Contravariant and Covariant)

- `Decider<C, Si, So, Ei, Eo>.dimapOnEvent(
  fl: (Ein) -> Ei, fr: (Eo) -> Eon
  ): Decider<C, Si, So, Ein, Eon>`
- `Decider<C, Si, So, Ei, Eo>.mapLeftOnEvent(f: (Ein) -> Ei): Decider<C, Si, So, Ein, Eo>`
- `Decider<C, Si, So, Ei, Eo>.mapOnEvent(f: (Eo) -> Eon): Decider<C, Si, So, Ei, Eon>`
- `Decider<C, Si, So, Ei, Eo>.dimapOnState(
  fl: (Sin) -> Si, fr: (So) -> Son
  ): Decider<C, Sin, Son, Ei, Eo>`
- `Decider<C, Si, So, Ei, Eo>.mapLeftOnState(f: (Sin) -> Si): Decider<C, Sin, So, Ei, Eo>`
- `Decider<C, Si, So, Ei, Eo>.mapOnState(f: (So) -> Son): Decider<C, Si, Son, Ei, Eo>`

#### Applicative

- `rjustOnS(so: So): Decider<C, Si, So, Ei, Eo>`
- `Decider<C, Si, So, Ei, Eo>.applyOnState(ff: Decider<C, Si, (So) -> Son, Ei, Eo>): Decider<C, Si, Son, Ei, Eo>`
- `Decider<C, Si, So, Ei, Eo>.productOnState(fb: Decider<C, Si, Son, Ei, Eo>): Decider<C, Si, Pair<So, Son>, Ei, Eo>`

#### Monoid

- `Decider<in C?, Si, So, in Ei?, out Eo>.combine(
  y: Decider<in Cn?, Sin, Son, in Ein?, out Eon>
  ): Decider<C_SUPER, Pair<Si, Sin>, Pair<So, Son>, Ei_SUPER, Eo_SUPER>`
- `Decider<C?, Si, So, Ei?, Eo>.combineDeciders(
  y: Decider<Cn?, Sin, Son, Ein?, Eon>
  ): Decider<Either<C, Cn>, Pair<Si, Sin>, Pair<So, Son>, Either<Ei, Ein>, Either<Eo, Eon>>`
- with identity element `Decider<Nothing, Unit, Nothing>`

We can now construct event-sourcing or/and state-storing aggregate by using the same `decider`.

### Event-sourcing aggregate

Event sourcing aggregate is using/delegating a `Decider` to handle commands and produce events. It belongs to the
Application layer. In order to handle the command, aggregate needs to fetch the current state (represented as a list of
events) via `EventRepository.fetchEvents` function, and then delegate the command to the decider which can produce new
events as a result. Produced events are then stored via `EventRepository.save` suspending function.

`EventSourcingAggregate` implements an interface `EventRepository` by delegating all of its public members to a
specified object. The Delegation pattern has proven to be a good alternative to implementation inheritance, and Kotlin
supports it natively requiring zero boilerplate code.

The `by` -clause in the supertype list for `EventSourcingAggregate` indicates that `eventRepository` will be stored
internally in objects of `EventSourcingAggregate` and the compiler will generate all the methods of `EventRepository`
that forward to `eventRepository`

> Flagging a computation as suspend enforces a calling context, meaning the compiler can ensure that we can’t call the effect from anywhere other than an environment prepared to run suspended effects. That will be another suspended function or a Coroutine.
> This effectively means we’re decoupling the pure declaration of our program logic (frequently called algebras in the functional world) from the runtime. And therefore, the runtime has the chance to see the big picture of our program and decide how to run and optimize it.

```kotlin
data class EventSourcingAggregate<C, S, E>(
    private val decider: Decider<C, S, E>,
    private val eventRepository: EventRepository<C, E>
) : EventRepository<C, E> by eventRepository {
    
    suspend fun handle(command: C): Either<Error, Iterable<Success.EventStoredSuccessfully<E>>> =
        // Arrow provides a Monad instance for Either. Except for the types signatures, our program remains unchanged when we compute over Either. All values on the left side assume to be Right biased and, whenever a Left value is found, the computation short-circuits, producing a result that is compatible with the function type signature.
        either {
            val events = command.fetchEvents().bind()
            val state = events.fold(decider.initialState, decider.evolve).validate().bind()
            decider.decide(command, state).save().bind()
        }

    private fun S.validate(): Either<Error, S> =
        if (decider.isTerminal(this)) Either.Left(Error.AggregateIsInTerminalState(this))
        else Either.Right(this)

}
```

### State-stored aggregate

State stored aggregate is using/delegating a `Decider` to handle commands and produce new state. It belongs to the
Application layer. In order to handle the command, aggregate needs to fetch the current state
via `StateRepository.fetchState` function first, and then delegate the command to the decider which can produce new
state as a result. New state is then stored via `StateRepository.save` suspending function.

`StateStoredAggregate` implements an interface `StateRepository` by delegating all of its public members to a specified
object. The Delegation pattern has proven to be a good alternative to implementation inheritance, and Kotlin supports it
natively requiring zero boilerplate code.

The `by` -clause in the supertype list for `StateStoredAggregate` indicates that `aggregateStateRepository` will be
stored internally in objects of `StateStoredAggregate` and the compiler will generate all the methods
of `StateRepository` that forward to `stateRepository`

```kotlin
data class StateStoredAggregate<C, S, E>(
    private val decider: Decider<C, S, E>,
    private val stateRepository: StateRepository<C, S>
) : StateRepository<C, S> by stateRepository {
    
    suspend fun handle(command: C): Either<Error, Success.StateStoredAndEventsPublishedSuccessfully<S, E>> =
        // Arrow provides a Monad instance for Either. Except for the types signatures, our program remains unchanged when we compute over Either. All values on the left side assume to be Right biased and, whenever a Left value is found, the computation short-circuits, producing a result that is compatible with the function type signature.
        either {
            val state = (command.fetchState().bind() ?: decider.initialState).validate().bind()
            val events = decider.decide(command, state)
            events.fold(state, decider.evolve).save()
                .map { s -> Success.StateStoredAndEventsPublishedSuccessfully(s.state, events) }.bind()
        }

    private fun S.validate(): Either<Error, S> =
        if (decider.isTerminal(this)) Either.Left(Error.AggregateIsInTerminalState(this))
        else Either.Right(this)
}
````

## View

`_View`  is a datatype that represents the event handling algorithm, responsible for translating the events into
denormalized state, which is more adequate for querying. It belongs to the Domain layer. It is usually used to create
the view/query side of the CQRS pattern. Obviously, the command side of the CQRS is usually event-sourced aggregate.

It has three generic parameters `Si`, `So`, `E`, representing the type of the values that `_View` may contain or use.
`_View` can be specialized for any type of `Si`, `So`, `E` because these types do not affect its behavior.
`_View` behaves the same for `E`=`Int` or `E`=`YourCustomType`, for example.

`_View` is a pure domain component.

- `Si` - input State
- `So` - output State
- `E`  - Event

We make a difference between input and output types, and we are more general in this case. We can always specialize down
to the 2 generic parameters: `typealias View<S, E> = _View<S, S, E>`

```kotlin
data class _View<Si, So, E>(
    val evolve: (Si, E) -> So,
    val initialState: So,
)

typealias View<S, E> = _View<S, S, E>
```

![view image](.assets/view.jpg)

### View extensions and functions

`View` defines a `monoid` in respect to the composition
operation: `(View<Sx,Ex?>, View<Sy,Ey?>) -> View<Pair(Sx,Sy), Either<Ex,Ey>>`, and this is an associative binary
operation `a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c`, with identity element `View<Unit, Nothing>`

#### Contravariant

- `View<Si, So, E>.mapLeftOnEvent(f: (En) -> E): View<Si, So, En>`

#### Profunctor (Contravariant and Covariant)

- `View<Si, So, E>.dimapOnState(
  fl: (Sin) -> Si, fr: (So) -> Son
  ): View<Sin, Son, E>`
- `View<Si, So, E>.mapLeftOnState(f: (Sin) -> Si): View<Sin, So, E>`
- `View<Si, So, E>.mapOnState(f: (So) -> Son): View<Si, Son, E>`

#### Applicative

- `View<Si, So, E>.applyOnState(ff: View<Si, (So) -> Son, E>): View<Si, Son, E>`
- `justOnState(so: So): View<Si, So, E>`

#### Monoid

- `View<Si, So, in E?>.combine(y: View<Si2, So2, in E2?>): View<Pair<Si, Si2>, Pair<So, So2>, E_SUPER>`
- `View<Si1, So1, E1?>.combineViews(y: View<Si2, So2, E2?>): View<Pair<Si1, Si2>, Pair<So1, So2>, Either<E1, E2>>`
- with identity element `View<Unit, Nothing>`

We can now construct `materialized` view by using this `view`.

### Materialized View

A Materialized view is using/delegating a `View` to handle events of type `E` and to maintain a state of denormalized
projection(s) as a result. Essentially, it represents the query/view side of the CQRS pattern. It belongs to the
Application layer.

In order to handle the event, materialized view needs to fetch the current state via `ViewStateRepository.fetchState`
suspending function first, and then delegate the event to the view, which can produce new state as a result. New state
is then stored via `ViewStateRepository.save` suspending function.

```kotlin
data class MaterializedView<S, E>(
    private val view: View<S, E>,
    private val viewStateRepository: ViewStateRepository<E, S>,
) : ViewStateRepository<E, S> by viewStateRepository {
    
    suspend fun handle(event: E): Either<Error, Success.StateStoredSuccessfully<S>> =
        // Arrow provides a Monad instance for Either. Except for the types signatures, our program remains unchanged when we compute over Either. All values on the left side assume to be Right biased and, whenever a Left value is found, the computation short-circuits, producing a result that is compatible with the function type signature.
        either {
            val oldState = event.fetchState().bind() ?: view.initialState
            val newState = view.evolve(oldState, event)
            newState.save().bind()
        }
}
```

## Saga

`_Saga` is a datatype that represents the central point of control, deciding what to execute next (`A`). It is
responsible for mapping different events from many aggregates into action results `AR` that the `_Saga` then can use to
calculate the next actions `A` to be mapped to commands of other aggregates.

`_Saga` is stateless, it does not maintain the state.

It has two generic parameters `AR`, `A`, representing the type of the values that `_Saga` may contain or use.
`_Saga` can be specialized for any type of `AR`, `A` because these types do not affect its behavior.
`_Saga` behaves the same for `AR`=`Int` or `AR`=`YourCustomType`, for example.

`_Saga` is a pure domain component.

- `AR` - Action Result
- `A`  - Action

```kotlin
data class _Saga<AR, A>(
    val react: (AR) -> Iterable<A>
)

typealias Saga<AR, A> = _Saga<AR, A>
```

![saga image](.assets/saga.jpg)

### Saga extensions and functions

`Saga` defines a `monoid` in respect to the composition
operation: `(Saga<ARx?, Ax>, Saga<ARy?, Ay>) -> Saga<Either<ARx, ARy>, Either<Ax, Ay>>`, and this is an associative
binary operation `a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c`, with identity element `Saga<Nothing, Nothing>`

#### Contravariant

- `Saga<AR, A>.mapLeftOnActionResult(f: (ARn) -> AR): Saga<ARn, A>`

#### Covariant

- `Saga<AR, A>.mapOnAction(f: (A) -> An): Saga<AR, An>`

#### Monoid

- `Saga<in AR?, out A>.combine(y: _Saga<in ARn?, out An>): Saga<AR_SUPER, A_SUPER>`
- `Saga<AR?, A>.combineSagas(y: Saga<ARn?, An>): Saga<Either<AR, ARn>, Either<A, An>>`
- with identity element `Saga<Nothing, Nothing>`

We can now construct `Saga Manager` by using this `saga`.

### Saga Manager

Saga manager is a stateless process orchestrator. It is reacting on Action Results of type `AR` and produces new
actions `A` based on them.

Saga manager is using/delegating a `Saga` to react on Action Results of type `AR` and produce new actions `A` which are
going to be published via `ActionPublisher.publish` suspending function.

It belongs to the Application layer.

```kotlin
data class SagaManager<AR, A>(
    private val saga: Saga<AR, A>,
    private val actionPublisher: ActionPublisher<A>,
) : ActionPublisher<A> by actionPublisher {

    suspend fun handle(actionResult: AR): Either<Error, Iterable<Success.ActionPublishedSuccessfully<A>>> =
        // Arrow provides a Monad instance for Either. Except for the types signatures, our program remains unchanged when we compute over Either. All values on the left side assume to be Right biased and, whenever a Left value is found, the computation short-circuits, producing a result that is compatible with the function type signature.
        either {
            saga.react(actionResult).publish().bind()
        }
}
```

## Kotlin

*"Kotlin has both object-oriented and functional constructs. You can use it in both OO and FP styles, or mix elements of
the two. With first-class support for features such as higher-order functions, function types and lambdas, Kotlin is a
great choice if you’re doing or exploring functional programming."*
